The incident took place on Saturday in Turbat, a town in Balochistan province, local police official Mohammad Mohsin said. He identified the slain journalist as Shaheena Shaheen, saying she worked for state-run Pakistan Television. Mr. Mohsin said Shaheen was dropped off at a hospital in critical condition by two men who then left as doctors tried to save her life. Police later learned that one of those men was the woman\u2019s husband, Nawabzada Mahrab. Police said raids were being carried out to arrest the husband after being alerted by the woman\u2019s uncle. In November, another man was accused of killing his journalist wife, Arooj Iqbal, in Lahore. Pakistani women often face harassment at the workplace, but many offenders escape punishment as victims don\u2019t report such incidents due to societal pressures. Pakistan is considered to be one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. "

Dinesh VarmaPUDUCHERRYFollowing a spate of COVID-19 deaths in recent days, the pandemic response in Puducherry is being reoriented to cut down on door-to-clinic delay among fever patients, alongside a thrust on expanding testing. In the last three days, the Union Territory recorded 54 deaths, including the highest of 20 in a 24-hour period on Friday. There have been 86 deaths since September 1. As of Sunday, the cumulative toll was 314, with the Union Territory for the first time clocking a case fatality rate of 1.84%, exceeding the national average of 1.71%.Mortality auditA mortality audit by the authorities found that a majority of the deaths had occurred within 72 hours of admission at the designated hospitals.The audit, which is held on Mondays every week by top officials of the Department of Disaster Management, also found that a majority of the patients who died of the infection were elderly and had underlying morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or chronic renal ailments. There have been a few deaths not linked to any pre-existing morbid condition.\u201cWe have launched a set of measures to get patients with the onset of symptoms to report to a neighbouring facility. This would help in testing and treatment at a referral hospital as early as possible,\u201d said T. Arun, Health Secretary and District Collector.Private medical colleges have been directed to scale up oxygen facilities. The institutions will need to increase oxygen equipment to 100 machines from the 42 at present, and ensure that 100 out of the 300 additional beds they have to earmark for COVID-19 care are equipped with oxygen apparatus by September 10.\u201cThe best outcomes will, however, also depend on a judicious use of available oxygen beds by institutions,\u201d Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said.Focus centresThe administration has launched a network of 15 COVID-19 focus centres to function as fever clinics to screen, test and collect samples, besides monitoring home isolation and treatment of patients. These clinics are in addition to the primary health centres diagnosing fever patients with ILI (influenza-like illness) or SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illness). Private hospitals and general practitioners have also been asked to refer patients with these signs to the nearest COVID-19 Care Centre or hospital. \u201cThe objective is the early detection and treatment of COVID cases, as well as testing the primary contacts of patients,\u201d Dr. Arun said.The Health Department has rolled out intensive door-to-door surveillance as part of the efforts to scale up the number of tests to about 3,000 a day. The campaign, which was launched by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Saturday from Kurunji Nagar and Krishna Nagar, was centred on Muthialpet on Sunday. Three teams are carrying out house-to-house visits in the locality. "

        "total news": "B. KrishnaKumar After a sharp rally in July, precious metals remained largely range bound in August. The upside momentum in July spilled over to the early part of August with comex gold spiking to all-time highs on August 4, before cooling off. The prices have since been consolidating in a trading range.Comex gold closed 0.4% lower in August to settle at $1,978.6 an ounce. The price action in comex silver was  more exciting with the metal gaining 16.6% to settle at $28.2 an ounce.In the domestic market, MCX gold futures closed 3.3% lower to settle at \u20b951,701 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures closed 3.6% higher to settle at \u20b967,318 a kg.Comex gold surged past the target zone of $2,020-2,030. The sharp rally in July has pushed the price of Comex gold into an overbought territory resulting in a cool-off or reversion to mean. This phase is likely to persist in the short-term.Comex gold may consolidate in the $1,910-$2,025 zone for a while.  The expectation is a breakout to the upside. A move past $2,030 would be a positive sign and may propel prices to the next major target of $2,100.Comex silver, too, achieved the target zone of $25.75-26 and has since been consolidating. It is likely to be confined to the $25.5-28.8 range in the short term. A move above $29.5 would be a sign of strength and trigger a rally to the next target of $31-$32. After moving past the target of \u20b955,200-\u20b955,500, MCX gold has been consolidating in a range recently. While the long-term trend is positive, a range-bound price action in the \u20b949,500-\u20b954,500 range is likely in the short term. A move above \u20b955,000 per 10 gm would signal the resumption of the long-term uptrend.Price action in MCX silver was similar to MCX gold. After moving past the earlier mentioned target of \u20b968,500-\u20b969,000, the price has eased into consolidation in August. It is likely to be confined to the range of \u20b964,000-\u20b970,000 in the near term. A breakout above \u20b970,500 may indicate resumption of the uptrend. To summarise, precious metals have been in consolidation mode, which is likely to sustain in the short term. The short-term trend would remain positive until the price breaches the lower end of the trading range mentioned above.(The author is a Chennai-based analyst/trader.

I want a personal financial plan. I have no insurance and my parents are aged. I am planning to buy a home. Also, how can I manage my funds after retirement?SamikA. Start with saving regularly. In another 8-10 years, you can seek the help of a financial planner to draw a plan for key goals and retirement. You have all the right traditional investment options. Continue them. Go for a good medical insurance policy and see if you can afford to add your parents, too, in the same policy. Get a pure term cover and make yourself provide adequately for your goals, loans, and the income loss your family could have for the next 10-20 years at least. Do not go for money-back policies. Build an emergency fund in short-term FDs equivalent to 3-6 months of expenses and keep renewing the same to cover any emergency needs for your family, especially in these tough times.For retirement, make sure you have good allocation towards equities in your NPS. Other than this, you can start with some SIPs in equity mutual funds. Instead of searching for high quality advice, simply choose equity index funds based on the Nifty index and the Nifty 500 index and invest in them regularly. You can use any online platform that offers direct plans of mutual funds. Keep this investment as part of your retirement kitty and do not be troubled by falls in the market. There is time for you to think about managing post-retirement money.As for buying a home, please don\u2019t rush into it until you are settled in your job and raise a family. Let your income grow to a level where you don\u2019t have to pay more than 30-40% of your income as EMI and you can still save and invest at least 10-20% of your income. You can start saving to cover the margin needed to buy a house with a mix of FDs and equity index funds.Q. I am a 24-year-old government employee. Given where the markets are, what are the options to achieve my financial requirements of buying a house at 32? Sai Prasad NaikA. You have eight years for your goal. That is a decent time to have a mix of various instruments. In other words, you should take an asset-allocated approach. Unless you are familiar with stock-market investing, don\u2019t venture into it for this goal. And, do not try to time your entry. It is hard even for seasoned investors. Simply go with SIPs in quality multi-cap equity  and corporate bond funds and add some money to FDs when the interest rate turns better in future. Bond markets, too, need timing and identifying low-risk and liquid options. Avoid it in case of insufficient knowledge. Debt funds will provide you with exposure to quality bonds. If you believe in gold, then consider 10-15% in it but only through gold mutual funds and not physical or digital gold. Consider it as a hedge to protect your portfolio when equity markets are down.Q. I am a commerce graduate, looking to gain knowledge about stock market Can you recommend some online courses?Lakshit SareenA. You could start with reading good books on finance by great investors/authors such as Benjamin Graham, Peter Lynch and John Bogle. You could also use all the free sources (including classes) from Professor Aswath Damodaran to learn about valuations. There are courses you can do on technical analysis but please know that technical analysis is not a hobby. It is serious business and needs full- time effort and dedication.

        "total news": "Venkatesh Bangaruswamy \n\nThe stock market tanked in March and yet again on the last day of August. While the crash in March was attributed to the outbreak of COVID-19, the political tension with our neighbour was cited as the reason for the fall in August. An investment portfolio is vulnerable to political uncertainty, natural calamity and financial crises. In this article, we discuss how you can moderate the effect of such factors on your portfolio.Returns trade-offAll of us typically invest in equity and bonds. Equity investments could be directly in stocks or through mutual funds and bond exposure would be typically in bank fixed or recurring deposits (FDs and RDs).Both bonds and equity offer two sources of returns. You can earn dividends and capital appreciation from equity, and interest income and capital appreciation from bonds. Now, investing in  FDs means giving up capital appreciation on  bond investment. However, you enjoy the certainty of cash flows on deposits as compensation for giving up capital appreciation.Suppose you want to buy a house six years hence, you can invest in a cumulative FD maturing in six years. You know today the cash flow you will receive six years later. Or, you can invest every month through RDs and still enjoy certainty in cash flows. An investment in a bond fund may generate capital appreciation but you would not know today the cash flows you will receive when you redeem units six years hence. Same is the case with  equity investments. That causes anxiety when the market tanks. So, what should you do to reduce emotional stress?Your equity investments should earn returns from both sources \u2014 dividends and capital appreciation. Dividends  cushion equity investments when markets tank because of broad market factors. For this reason, dividend-paying stocks (along with gold) can be considered as comfort investments; they offer you comfort when your portfolio value declines.There are two other reasons why dividends can be an important source of returns on your portfolio. Barring unforeseen circumstances, receiving dividends is certain after a company announces the record date for dividend payments. Typically, when the market tanks, such certainty in cash flows becomes an important factor for investors. Therefore, there is good demand for high dividend-paying stocks during such times, especially closer to the record date.The second reason is psychological. You tend to be more patient with your investment when it has already earned some returns or is expected to offer fixed cash flows. So, receiving dividends will encourage you to hold dividend-paying stocks for a while even if the market tanks. When the market revives, you may be able to also earn capital appreciation on your investment. Note that dividends will be taxed at your marginal tax rate which may be higher than the tax on capital gains on  equity investments.ConclusionIf income is the primary source of return on your investment, you can give up capital appreciation to enjoy the benefit of stable cash flows. But if the primary source of return on investment is capital appreciation (equity), you should, if possible, aim to also earn income returns. Having two sources of returns makes such investments less risky compared with investments that earn only capital appreciation.There are two ways in which you can capture dividends. You can directly invest in shares after a company announces dividends. Note that dividend yield (dividends upon current market price) should be at least 4-5% if you want to build some cushion to reduce risk on your equity investments. Alternatively, you can buy equity funds that invest in high dividend-yield stocks.(The author offers training programmes for individuals to manage their personal investments)"

In Chennai, families, including children, thronged Marina Beach, and youngsters were spotted playing cricket and football on the Corporation playgrounds. The Marina Service Road was busy, with walkers, joggers and skaters using it. \u201cMost of them had masks but they wore it on the jaw. A few helpless police personnel were watching people walk past.

Nagar resident.Out in the open\u201cWe were happy to hear that the grounds have been opened. Many of those who had come to play wore masks. Most of them used kerchiefs to cover their nose and mouth.

        "total news": "Naveen KukrejaIMAGING: J.A. PREMKUMARThe moratorium offered by banks and other institutional lenders ended last month. However, the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and the resultant income and job loss continue to a large degree. In this scenario, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced a loan restructuring plan to offer relief to impacted borrowers, who may struggle to repay their debt over the short term, at least. This  plan is unique in many ways. Unlike the earlier restructuring windows with a largely open-ended structure, the latest resolution framework has a strict entry barrier and a clearly defined timeline for the implementation of the scheme. Also, unlike the moratorium on term loans that was open for all, only those borrowers whose income has been adversely impacted due to the pandemic and repayment capacity seriously restricted would be eligible for the loan restructuring scheme offered by the lender.This is also the first time that the RBI has announced a resolution plan specifically for retail loans.Holistic solutionThe primary objective of the loan recast plan is to provide a holistic solution to the liquidity and viability-related issues faced by existing borrowers in the personal loan segment, along with the corporate and MSME loan categories. The RBI has acknowledged the need to address the deeper cash flows issues faced by borrowers, a large section of whom have an otherwise good repayment history. According to RBI\u2019s Financial Stability Report released in July , about 50% of individual loan borrowers had availed themselves of the moratorium as on April 30.As a result, most banks and institutional lenders would have feared a significant rise in NPAs in the next few months. But, if implemented well by lenders, the restructuring plan will allow the lending system to spread the probable systemic shock over a longer period of time. Hopefully, the plan will not only provide huge relief to the genuinely- stressed borrowers but also help maintain the overall health of the lending sector.Currently, most lenders, including the large banks, are being cautious in issuing new loans. Only borrowers with a steady income, who have been unscathed by the pandemic financially and have a solid repayment history are predominantly being catered to. This is likely to continue till the time lenders have a clear picture of the repayment capacity of existing borrowers, which should happen over the next couple of months. In the RBI\u2019s lexicon, the term \u2018personal loan\u2019 includes gold, education, home, personal, consumer durable and car loans, credit card dues and loan against securities (other than those sanctioned for business and commercial purposes).Loan recast goalThe objective of the loan restructuring plan is to clearly provide relief to the maximum number of retail borrowers, who may struggle to service existing debt, by allowing them to repay as per their changed repayment capacity. The RBI has outlined a broad framework for the lenders to resolve the stress in personal loan assets. Lenders may provide relief to impacted borrowers by rescheduling loan repayments, conversion of any interest already accrued or to be accrued in future into another loan and through granting loan moratorium subject to a maximum of two years.This is only a broad framework and personal loan borrowers would need to wait for their lender to announce details on the various options that may be available and the associated eligibility criterion.However, any restructuring one goes for will come at a price such as higher interest cost and may have a long-term implication on the financial future. Hence, only those genuinely affected by the COVID-19  crisis and struggling to repay debt should opt for loan resolution.Borrowers should also consider the fact that the loans taken up for restructuring will be reflected in credit reports as \u2018restructured.\u2019 This is likely to have an adverse impact on  credit score and thereby, borrowers\u2019 chances of availing another loan or credit card may plummet significantly in the future.My advice for those whose income has been considerably impaired is to opt for rescheduling of loan repayments. Be disciplined and start repaying according to your reduced repayment capacity. Only those who have no, or little, means to make repayments over a longer time horizon should opt for the moratorium. But do go through the various options available with your lender, before taking a decision. (The author is CEO & Co-founder, Paisabazaar.com)"

        "total news": "Associated Press\nNEW YORK\nDonald Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen, in a tell-all memoir, makes the case that the President is \u201cguilty of the same crimes\u201d that landed him in federal prison, offering a blow-by-blow account of Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged role in a hush money scandal that once overshadowed his presidency. Of all the crises Mr. Cohen confronted working for Mr. Trump, none proved as vexing as the porn actress Stormy Daniels and her claims of an extramarital affair with Mr. Trump, Cohen writes in Disloyal- The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.Mr. Trump, despite his later protestations, green-lighted the $1,30,000 payment to silence Ms. Daniels ahead of the 2016 election, reasoning he would \u201chave to pay\u201d his wife a far greater sum if the affair ever became known, Mr. Cohen writes, adding the President later reimbursed him with \u201cfake legal fees.\u201d \u201cIt never pays to settle these things, but many, many friends have advised me to pay,\u201d Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Cohen. \u201cIf it comes out, I\u2019m not sure how it would play with my supporters. But I bet they\u2019d think it\u2019s cool that I slept with a porn star.\u201d The White House called Mr. Cohen\u2019s memoir \u201cfan fiction.\u201d \u201cHe readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,\u201d White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.\u201d The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday. Mr. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and other crimes, including lying to Congress, calls himself the \u201cstar witness\u201d of a hush-money conspiracy that still could culminate in charges for Mr. Trump after he leaves office. He described his new book as a \u201cfundamental piece of evidence\u201d of the President\u2019s guilt. He assails Mr. Trump as an \u201corganized crime don\u201d and \u201cmaster manipulator,\u201d but says he once considered him a father figure. Mr. Cohen also sheds light on Trump\u2019s admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he admired him most because he \u201chad the balls to take over an entire nation and run it like it was his personal company.\u201d"

        "total news": "Agence France-Presse\nBerlin\nTensions deepened between Germany and Russia over the alleged poisoning of opposition figure Alexei Navalny on Sunday, with Germany threatening sanctions and Russia accusing Berlin of delaying the investigation it demanded. The Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption campaigner fell ill on a flight last month and was treated in a Siberian hospital before being evacuated to Berlin.Germany said last week there was \u201cunequivocal evidence\u201d that President Vladimir Putin\u2019s top foe had been poisoned using the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok.Germany will discuss possible sanctions against Russia if the Kremlin does not provide an explanation soon, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Sunday.\u201cWe have high expectations of the Russian government to solve this serious crime,\u201d Mr. Maas told German daily Bild. \u201cIf the government has nothing to do with the attack, then it is in its own interest to back this up with facts.\u201d\u2018Russis needs to clarify\u2019If Russia does not help clarify what happened \u201cin the coming days\u201d, Germany will be compelled to \u201cdiscuss a response with our allies,\u201d Mr. Maas said.Any sanctions decided should be \u201ctargeted\u201d, he added. Britain said on Sunday that Russia had \u201ca very serious set of questions to answer\u201d and it was \u201cclear\u201d the Kremlin critic was poisoned with Novichok.The Kremlin has denied responsibility for the attack and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Germany is yet to share any findings with Moscow\u2019s prosecutors.Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova on Sunday accused Germany of stalling efforts to probe the case.German authorities had failed to respond to a request by Russian prosecutors sent on August 27, she said in a Facebook post. \u201cDear Mr. Maas, if the German government is sincere in its statements then it should be interested in preparing a response to a request of the Russian Prosecutor General\u2019s Office as soon as possible,\u201d Ms. Zakharova said.\u2018Double game\u2019\u201cSo far we are not certain that Germany is not playing a double game,\u201d she added. \u201cWhere is the \u2018urgency\u2019 you are insisting upon?\u201cBy not sending its answer, Berlin is stalling the process of investigation for which it\u2019s calling. On purpose?\u201d Mr. Maas said on Sunday there were \u201cseveral indications\u201d that Russia was behind the poisoning, in the strongest accusations yet from Germany. \u201cThe deadly substance with which Navalny was poisoned has in the past been found in the hands of Russian authorities.\u201dOn the subject of which sanctions could be discussed by the EU, Maas did not rule out action relating to Nord Stream 2, a multi-billion-euro Russian-German gas pipeline nearing completion that has drawn the ire of US and European partners alike.\u201cI hope... that the Russians do not force us to change our position on Nord Stream,\u201d Mr. Maas said."

        "total news": "Agence France-Presse\nHong Kong\nNearly 300 people were arrested by Hong Kong police on Sunday as riot officers swooped on democracy protesters opposed to the postponement of local elections.Sunday was meant to be voting day for the city\u2019s partially elected legislature, one of the few instances where residents of Hong Kong get to cast ballots.But the city\u2019s pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam suspended the polls for a year \u2014 citing the coronavirus \u2014 angering the pro-democracy opposition who had been hoping to capitalise on seething anti-government sentiment.Hundreds of riot police flooded the district of Kowloon in a bid to thwart online calls for flash mob protests to mark the suspended vote.Throughout the afternoon officers were heckled by people shouting slogans such as \u201cGive me back my vote!\u201d and \u201cCorrupt cops!\u201d as officers conducted multiple stop and searches and ordered crowds to disperse.In a Facebook statement, police said at least 289 people were arrested, mostly for unlawful assembly.One woman was detained under a new security law Beijing imposed on the city for chanting independence slogans, the force added.Live images showed three prominent pro-democracy politicians \u2014 Leung Kwok-hung, Figo Chan and Raphael Wong \u2014 were among those held.Sedition chargeThe protests came hours after the police\u2019s newly formed national security unit arrested Tam Tak-chi, another democracy activist and radio DJ, for \u201cuttering seditious words\u201d \u2014 a colonial-era offence.Mr. Tam is the latest in a long line of government critics to find themselves facing prosecution in recent months for their involvement in protests.When they announced the arrest on Sunday morning, police did not explain what Tam may have said that was considered seditious.Hong Kong government condemned the protesters\u2019 \u201cunlawful and selfish acts\u201d in a statement issued on Sunday evening. \u201cThe first priority for Hong Kong currently is to unite as one and fight the virus together with concentrated resources,\u201d a government spokesperson said.Beijing has initiated a widespread crackdown against its critics in Hong Kong after the financial hub was rocked by seven straight months of huge and often violent pro-democracy protests last year.Rallies have been all but outlawed this year with authorities citing both security concerns and wielding emergency anti-coronavirus laws to ban public gatherings in the city.In late June, Beijing also imposed its new security law, which bans anything authorities perceive to be secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.At least 22 people have been arrested under the new law since it came into effect, sending a chill through the city."

Lawyers for Mr. Assange and the U.S. government are scheduled to face off in London on Monday at an extradition hearing that was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges adding up to a maximum sentence of 175 years. His lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists at risk. Mr. Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said the case \u201cis fundamentally about basic human rights and freedom of speech.\u201d American prosecutors say Mr. Assange is a criminal, not a free-speech hero. Mr. Assange argues he is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and says the leaked documents exposed U.S. military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists. "

For such grievances, parents have been asked to email the State parent-teacher association at grievancesredressaltnpta@gmail.com for redressal. They can also reach out through the State education helpline 14417. The Commissioner has also asked the CEOs to ensure that schools give students and parents the contact information of their counsellors and put it up on their websites.A circular containing these details as well as the relevant portions of the guidelines will soon be circulated among parents by all schools. Kalvi TV, which has been televising lessons over the last few months, also airs a programme from 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. on counselling, which schools have been directed to show students.To train teachers and counsellors in keeping online classes safe and sustainable, the Tamil Nadu Teachers\u2019 Platform will host a programme in short-learning modules.

Vasanthakumar, who had tested positive for COVID-19. The Election Commission of India is yet to announce the date for the bypoll.The last time the constituency faced a byelection was in January 1969. The byelection became notable for a variety of reasons such as the electoral comeback of former Chief Minister K. Kamaraj, who had tasted a stunning defeat in Virudhunagar during the 1967 Assembly polls, and violent clashes between volunteers of the Congress and the DMK. \u2018A terrible election\u2019\u201cThat was a terrible election,\u201d recalled B.S. Gnanadesikan, senior vice-president of the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and who, as a college student, worked for Kamaraj.The situation in the constituency turned so tense that Superintendent of Police S. Dayasankar went on medical leave a few days before the day of polling (January 8, 1969) and the then Chief Election Commissioner, S.P. Sen Verma, and Inspector General of Police (which was the ultimate rank in the State police then) R.M. Mahadevan camped in Nagercoil to oversee the election. A record turnout of 78.6% was registered. Kamaraj won by a comfortable margin of 1.28 lakh votes over his nearest rival and Swatantara party\u2019s functionary, M. Mathias, who contested as an independent candidate with the DMK\u2019s support. As the then Chief Minister, C.N. Annadurai, was suffering from cancer, Public Works Minister M. Karunanidhi had taken charge of the campaign of his party\u2019s ally.Ever since Kanniyakumari became a part of Tamil Nadu in 1956, the constituency has generally returned candidates belonging to the Congress family of parties or those backed by the Congress. Only on two occasions \u2014 1999 and 2014 \u2014 did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)\u2019s Pon Radhakrishnan emerge victorious amid intense multi-cornered contests. Alluding to the population mix of the  district (where Hindus, according to the 2017 district statistical handbook, account for about 51% of the population and Christians, around 44%), H. Raja, senior BJP leader and former prabhari (in-charge) of the district in the 1990s, asserted that the factor of religion had been the principal feature of politics in the area. \u201cWe had faced defeat when votes of the Hindus got divided,\u201d he observed. He contended that in 2019, voters \u201cgot carried away\u201d by the campaign of the Opposition, which harped on the theme that Narendra Modi would not become Prime Minister again, apart from making several \u201ctempting promises\u201d. However, he is hopeful of his party\u2019s success this time, as \u201cno such trick\u201d will work any longer.Communal polarisation A senior Congress leader, who hails from the southern belt, conceded that communal polarisation in the electoral sense was a \u201cfact of life\u201d in Kanniyakumari and this happened only after the entry of the BJP. The \u201cconsolidation of minorities\u201d, especially Christians, has happened as \u201ca result of intensified activity\u201d of the RSS and the BJP in the district. The Congress\u2019 \u201cconsistent victory\u201d has to be viewed as a \u201creflection\u201d of the anti-BJP trend, he added. "

With transportation opening up, more people are stepping out to make purchases, and we hope the trend continues,\u201d said P.A. Ravindran, general manager of Chennai Silks. \u201cThe numbers look good but are still far from normal.

There was brisk business,\u201d said Baasha, a vendor. Many restaurants and eateries, which remained closed for over five months, have now reopened. A small-time restaurateur, who sells biryani, said this Sunday had been the most energetic day for him in a while as many customers walked in. \u201cOnce trains start running, there will be more business for me,\u201d he added. Other restaurants in the city saw a marginal increase in footfalls this weekend as customers came with their families. \u201cThere was a 10%-15% increase in footfalls this weekend.

Some of the most powerful minds in the country, depleted though their ranks may be by the unfortunate defection of the Moderates, have been brought to bear upon the problem and in the result the discussion in the Subjects Commission has taken a very high level. It would be interesting to speculate upon the evolution of the Subjects Committee as a kind of miniature Congress. With the inevitable emergence of parties in the Congress itself the Subjects Committee has become the real arena for different parties to fight their battles in. To the Congress is left the final choice but the nature of its composition precludes any possibility of adequate or even restrained debate. "

        "total news": "Armida Salsiah AlisjahbanaAs the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic spread across  Asia and the Pacific, finance ministries are continuing their efforts to inject trillions of dollars for emergency health responses and fiscal packages. With continued lockdown measures and restricted borders, economic rebound seems uncertain. Compared to 2019\u2019s economic situation, over the past six months, countries in Asia and the Pacific have been experiencing sharp drops in foreign exchange inflows due to declines in export earnings, remittances, tourism and FDI. This is worrying as policymakers are tackling difficult choices over how to prioritise development spending, while continuing to expand their squeezed fiscal space.Financing in three key areasThe United Nations is contributing through a global initiative, Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond, co-convened by Canada and Jamaica, to articulate a comprehensive financing strategy to safeguard the Sustainable Development Goals. Governments are united to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to steer an inclusive, sustainable and resilient post-COVID-19 recovery. In the Asia-Pacific region, several countries have already adopted financing plans in three key areas. They aim to address the challenge of diminished fiscal space and debt vulnerability; to ensure sustainable recovery, consistent with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda; and to harness the potential of regional cooperation in support of financing for development.The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has recently launched its first-ever Regional Conversation Series on Building Back Better. We are joining forces with ministers, decision-makers, private sectors and heads of international agencies to share collective insights on sharing pathways to resilient recovery from health pandemic and economic collapse.To improve the fiscal space and manage high levels of debt distress, a growing call for extending the debt moratorium under global initiatives like the Debt Service Suspension initiative is timely. Central banks can continue to keep the balance  of supporting the economy and maintaining financial stability. This further involves enhancing tax reforms and improving debt management capacities, while using limited fiscal space to invest in priority sectors. Exploring sustainability-oriented bonds and innovative financing instruments options such as debt swaps for SDG investment should be explored further.In addition to economic considerations, the policy paradigm  must mainstream affordable, accessible and green infrastructure standards, while promoting social equality and environmental sustainability principles as enshrined in the Paris Agreement. As we scale up the use of digital technology and innovative applications, the financing support of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises must go hand in hand with these national job-rich recovery strategies. Regional cooperationNo country can take this agenda forward alone. Regionally coordinated financing policies can restart trade, reorganise supply chains and revitalise sustainable tourism in a safe manner. Across Asia and the Pacific, governments must pool financial resources to create regional investment funds. Strengthening regional cooperation platforms to ensure that all countries receive an equitable number of doses of the vaccine on short notice to everyone everywhere is particularly essential. Through ESCAP, we can scale these efforts across the region, working closely with our member states, the private sector and innovators to build a collective financing response to mobilise the necessary additional resources. Together, we can chart financing strategies of Asia and the Pacific which can enhance societal well being and economic resilience of future pandemics and crises.

        "total news": "Most of the anti-national acts of individual citizens in a democracy are the outcome of their mental confusion. The confusion consists in identifying the government in power with the State and heaping injuries on State symbols like the national flag, the national anthem and the Constitution in a bid intended to wound only the party in office. The psychological effects of such confused action are easy to assess: Repeated insults to the nation in its symbols will make a mockery of the symbols and, as the habit spreads, the sense of national oneness which these symbols had been designed to infuse will get progressively weakened. The Bill introduced by the Union Government in the Lok Sabha to prevent such insults through specific penalties like imprisonment for three years or a fine or both has come none too soon. But such legislation has its limits. For instance, the Bill seeks to punish wanton disrespect to the national anthem, flag and Constitution. Apart from the theoretical possibilities for proving the existence of extenuating circumstances even in the case of wanton disrespect and thus escaping punishment, constraints on such misbehaviour can never be effectively enforced by laws alone."

        "total news": "There were questions from readers about my last column, \u2018Popular ideas must replace populist ideas\u2019 (August 31), that asked for some form of accountability from India\u2019s news channels. One reader asked whether other media platforms are free from errors and asked why television had been singled out for harsh evaluation.The criticism flows from a wrong reading of the column which tried to explain the role of the media in creating our public sphere. Public sphere is a nebulous construct. If arguments in the public sphere are woven with facts,  we get a fine tapestry. However, if they are woven with disinformation,  we get a toxic environment. Disinformation is different from inadvertent errors caused by oversight. It is true that many respected media outlets, including The Hindu, have carried errors. But these reports have often been corrected at the first instance. I  argued in my column, \u2018Invisible mending undermines trust\u2019 (August 15, 2016), that the act of visible mending makes journalism more dependable.Refusal to acknowledge mistakesMy concern is about the trust factor in the news media which has suffered a decline in the last decade. The decline in standards in television is galling because many TV channels refuse to acknowledge their mistakes, and seldom rectify their misleading or inaccurate stories. For instance, earlier this month, Alt News, a fact-checking organisation, pointed out how two TV channels of the India Today Group and one channel of The Times Group aired old images of a Chinese military cemetery as graves of Chinese soldiers killed in Galwan. With the border situation remaining tense along the Line of Actual Control, one expects media organisations to provide credible information.What we learn from the Alt News report is that the reports in these channels were not inadvertent errors but disinformation.  The channels speculated that the death toll is anywhere between 40 to 100 soldiers. The fact remains that none of them is sure of Chinese casualties in the June face-off between India and China in Galwan Valley. On August 31 , Aaj Tak claimed that it was airing \u201cexclusive\u201d images proving that \u201c40 PLA soldiers\u201d were killed in the cross-border clashes. The report said: \u201cWe are showing you pictures of the graves of Chinese soldiers. Several people in the country wanted proof of the Chinese soldiers who were killed in Galwan clashes. The proof is on your television screens\u2026more than 40 Chinese soldiers died in clashes with India and you can watch how Chinese soldiers paid respect to their tombs.\u201d  India Today also broadcast similar visuals. It showed satellite imagery of the same set of graves with two red arrows pointing at a specific area claiming that those were \u201cnew graves\u201d. And Times Now reported: \u201cPhotos of 106 PLA tombstones reveal [the] extent of Chinese casualties in June 15 Galwan clash.\u201d Alt News found that the image aired by India Today dated back to 2011.The \u2018backfire effect\u2019Television journalists seem to have bought the \u2018backfire effect\u2019 lock, stock, and barrel. The \u2018backfire effect\u2019 is an idea propounded by American academics Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler in their paper, \u2018When Corrections Fail: The persistence of political misperceptions\u2019. Their argument is that when a claim aligns with someone\u2019s ideological beliefs, telling them that it is wrong will actually make them believe it more strongly. The emergence of populist leaders  seems to have cemented the idea of the \u2018backfire effect\u2019 in most television newsrooms.Amy Sippitt, as Research Manager at the British fact-checking organisation, Full Fact, worked on this contentious issue in a systematic manner. Her study titled \u2018Does the \u201cbackfire effect\u201d exist \u2014 and does it matter for factcheckers?\u2019 suggests that fact-checking does help inform citizens. \u2018Backfire effects\u2019 are rare; they are not the norm. One of the important conclusions of the Full Fact study is that we still need more evidence to understand how fact-checking content can be most effective. The American Press Institute said that in journalism, \u201cgetting it right\u201d is the foundation upon which everything else is built \u2014 context, interpretation, comment, criticism, analysis and debate. The \u2018backfire effect\u2019 cannot be used as an excuse not to verify information before putting it out in the public domain.readerseditor@thehindu.co.in"

        "total news": "There is a debate on the number of deaths in India caused by COVID-19. The official number as on August 26 was 59,449. Nobody believes this number to be true, yet nobody has an alternative number. So, when two young scientists conjured up a specific estimate of 1,88,939 deaths on July 31 based on an ingenuously simple approach (multiply the reported deaths by five) in an article in these pages, they were criticised. There is also a campaign by activists asking the government to put COVID-19 deaths-related data in the public domain. Before we discuss the merit of these two arguments, we need to be clear about the urgency of the need of this estimate. While knowing the number of COVID-19 deaths is a good indicator of burden, this alone is not of much use in planning our current public health strategies, for which case fatality rates or infection fatality rates are far more useful. Also, as the pandemic is far from over, this estimate becomes outdated almost the instant it is generated. Despite this, there is no question that such an estimate needs to be generated, if only for academic purposes. It also gives us an opportunity to be better prepared for such estimations in future.There are two kinds of challenges in estimating the number of deaths due to COVID-19 \u2013 the first is related to weaknesses in our mortality surveillance system; the second to COVID-19-specific issues. It might also be relevant to point out that even for other diseases, estimating the number of deaths  is a problem. Counting deathsIn an ideal world, we would be able to count all deaths and have a certified cause of death in all the cases. In the real world, we have neither. According to the Civil Registration Scheme report for 2018, 86% of all deaths were registered, with 34% being through hospitals. However, this would not be a good source for cause of death as it is as reported by the next of kin at the time of registration. The second source of cause of death is the medical certification of cause of death (MCCD). As per the report released by the Office of the Registrar General of India (ORGI) in 2018, 1.45 million deaths (21% of all registered deaths and hence, multiplication by five suggested by the scientists) were medically certified. MCCD has an urban bias and there are also issues related to quality of death certification by doctors. The scientists mentioned above ignored the fact that COVID-19 has largely been an urban phenomenon till now, where medical certification coverage is much better, and also did not address COVID-19-specific issues. The third and final source for cause of death is the Sample Registration System. Here good quality mortality surveillance is carried out in a small representative population.  All identified deaths are noted by a trained worker using standard procedures to generate information which is reviewed by a doctor to arrive at a cause of death. This occurs in a small number of deaths (40,000-45,000) nationally per year. However, due to  delays in the process, this information is available in the public domain only till 2013. Impact of the pandemic In addition, COVID-19 has  adversely impacted death registrations due to lockdowns, travel restrictions as well as social stigma resulting in people hiding these deaths. As COVID-19 moves to rural areas,  these challenges are going to worsen. Also, as many of these systems are not yet fully electronic, there will be a delay in the availability of these data even after registration. Thus, it is quite likely that the data available with the ORGI for 2020 will need evaluation for its usefulness for estimation procedures, even if made public. I have always supported efforts to put publicly funded data in the public domain. Yet, I would caution against uncontrolled access in this case.Identifying COVID-19-specific mortality is a challenge across the globe. An approach of using reported death data would be applicable if all those who developed COVID-19 were tested and their deaths certified. However,  there are serious limitations of test availability due to restrictive criteria for access and use, even for people with symptoms. Without testing of all suspected cases, healthcare providers have to rely on clinical features to label a death as being due to COVID-19. Our inability to differentiate these from other causes of death may result in misclassification. Without testing, it is going to be difficult for a doctor to differentiate between COVID-19 and, say, influenza. The second issue is related to defining indirect deaths caused by COVID-19. Due to societal and health system disruptions, the pandemic is likely to contribute to deaths from other causes \u2014 suicides, non-communicable diseases, tuberculosis. Also, think of a person who had a compromised heart which was worsened when she suffered a COVID-19 infection, precipitating a heart attack, which otherwise would not have occurred now. In a sense, this is also a death caused by COVID-19 as it initiated the final sequence of events leading to death. However, a doctor would certify this as a cardiac death as one cannot ever be sure that COVID-19 initiated the process. How do we include this in our estimate? All these factors will have to be considered when we estimate COVID-19-related deaths.So, what is the way out? Almost all the issues mentioned for COVID-19 are also applicable to influenza. For the swine flu pandemic of 2009, an estimate published in The Lancet in 2012 indicated that the real mortality was 15 times higher than the globally reported laboratory-confirmed cases. For many years, influenza-associated mortality has been estimated using an indirect modelling approach based on the concept of \u2018excess mortality\u2019. An estimate for influenza mortality in India using the same approach based on above data sources has been generated by my team. Such exercises always give you a range and not a single estimate.Excess mortalityEven countries with near-complete registration of deaths in normal times have acknowledged that their officially recorded COVID-19 death tolls might be underestimates and they are now focusing on excess mortality \u2013 the number of deaths above that expected during \u2018normal\u2019 times. This approach first statistically defines the \u2018expected\u2019 number of deaths in a given period in a given population using past mortality records and then uses the 2020 mortality data to estimate increase in rates of death beyond what would be expected if SARS-CoV-2 had not circulated. The \u2018excess death\u2019 approach would include deaths directly (pneumonia or other respiratory conditions) as well as indirectly caused by the pandemic or its interventions (cardiac conditions). It will have to be acknowledged here that lockdowns may have had a preventive effect on some other deaths, notably road accidents and pollution-linked deaths. Depending on the availability of data and analytic capacity, this can lead to a real-time measurement of excess mortality or it could be an exercise done at the end of the epidemic.Thus, the estimation of \u2018true\u2019 mortality due to COVID-19 is likely to pose significant methodological and systemic challenges. However, sufficient technical capacity exists in the country to do so. It should be noted that deficiencies in mortality surveillance have existed for a long time. There is no denying that these need to be addressed urgently.Anand Krishnan is a Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at the AIIMS, New Delhi"

Rumours of the government stopping the subsidy are also adding fuel to the fire. \u201cAt least five customers walk in seeking clarification on a daily basis, especially since they do not get text messages from banks as the amount is too small. They are used to the subsidy being over \u20b9200. During this time last year, it was over \u20b9100. This month it is \u20b924 in the city. The amount varies according to the market. The government gives more subsidy to the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana customers. In fact, it has given three free cylinders to them,\u201d an LPG distributor in the city said.Bharat Petroleum\u2019s saleOil industry sources said the government was planning to do away with the LPG subsidy. \u201cThe proposed sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation is causing disturbance in the market. Consumers are apprehensive about how the new owner will treat them. They wonder if the subsidy will continue and if the same level of service will be maintained,\u201d another distributor said. Distributors said there should be some kind of announcement regarding this to reassure the consumers. On the other hand, consumers are facing issues with the receipt of delivery authentication codes (DAC) that they have to provide to the delivery personnel. \u201cMany times they don\u2019t get the code because their message inbox will be full or the mobile number might have changed. Around 15%- 20% of consumers walk in daily with issues relating to the DAC,\u201d the manager at an agency said. Oil industry officials said deliveries would be carried out even if the consumers did not get the DAC. It is a mode of contactless delivery, they said."

Addressing the party\u2019s special general body meeting held virtually, in which 20 resolutions were adopted, PMK founder S.

Given his political position and status as a Governor-nominee in the Syndicate, it would be easy for the BJP leader to dominate the Syndicate meeting and bring about changes that suited his party\u2019s ideology and none would dare challenge him, Mr. Pasupathy said. Former AUT office-bearer Prof. Pichandy said while there was no question about Mr. Kanagasabapathi\u2019s integrity, the Association\u2019s objection was only on the ground that he held a prominent position in a party.  \u201cIt would have been better had the Governor-Chancellor thought through his nomination,\u201d he said and pointed out that the AUT had not objected to Mr. Kanagasabapathi\u2019s nomination three years ago.

When contacted, Prof. Kanagasabapathi said those objecting to his nomination cited his political affiliation as a reason as they could not complain about his impartiality or academic achievements. He claimed they were opposing his nomination because in the last three Syndicate meetings, he had objected to various violations and placed dissent notes. "

Sundar\n\nRajapalayam\nA road being laid within the eco-sensitive zone of the Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary, without permission from the Forest Department, could pose a threat to the movement of wildlife, activists say. If not stopped in the initial stages, the road being laid, which is backed by local politicians from an opposition party, would eventually lead to the mushrooming of farmhouses and resorts, block the movement of elephants and harm ecology and wildlife, activists warn. Based on a complaint from activist A.S. Murugan, the Wildlife Warden of the Grizzled Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary, Srivilliputtur, P. Mohammed Shabab, has ordered an enquiry by an official in the rank of Assistant Conservator of Forest. Mr. Murugan said while the eco-sensitive zone in the sanctuary was up to 5 km from the border of the reserve forest, the road, nearly 5 km-long, had been planned along the \u201czero point\u201d of the zone, abutting the reserved forest areas in Kottaimalai and Pullupathi beats, along the foothills of the Western Ghats. \u201cWhen we heard about the issue, a group of environmental activists, including advocates from the Madras High Court visited the site a few days ago. We observed that wildlife, including elephants, leopards, sloth bear, deer and dholes, were moving in the area,\u201d he said. Stating that the site was surrounded by hills on three sides, he said rainwater from the hills would drain into the valley, and there were several small and big ponds used by the wild animals.Culverts constructedM. Suresh, an advocate, said that after they took up the issue with the Block Development Office in Rajapalayam and the Department of Forests, the work on the road had been expedited. So far, a few culverts had been constructed over the wild streams. \u201cWe found that four heavy earthmoving machineries had been deployed to level the ground for laying the road. An official in the BDO office claimed ignorance about the need to get permission from the Central Empowered Committee of the National Board of Wildlife for taking up any construction work in the eco-sensitive zone,\" he said. A forest official admitted that the bridges had been constructed in the eco-sensitive zone. However, no roads had been laid. Though no permission had been sought from the Department of Forest, the official said that they needed to get some documents from the local authorities. The activists wondered as to why so much of money was being spent to lay a road where no one lived. \u201cWe suspect that someone is trying to promote real-estate and construction of farm houses. They are also attempting to divert the natural flow of streams to suit their requirements,\u201d Mr. Murugan alleged. According to the complaint, the proposed road was in violation of the Revenue Standing Order, which stipulated that any activity should be carried out beyond 40 m of the Reserved Forest boundary."

        "total news": "Jacob Koshy\nNEW DELHI\nShutting down thermal power plants older than 20 years in 11 key States can save the exchequer \u20b953,000 crore over five years, says an analysis by Climate Research Horizon. The savings will accrue from not having to spend on retrofitting these plants to reduce the toxicity of their emissions, as well as switching to renewable energy, the authors estimate.These projections also come at a time when India has announced plans to auction 41 coal mining blocks in an ostensible bid to be less reliant on imported coal. Surplus capacitySeveral of the power distribution companies (discoms) are financially stressed though India has surplus power generation capacity. While free power for agriculture and power theft are one reason, the authors opine, another is that several States have installed capacity based on projections that are far in excess of actual requirements.\u201cThis has resulted in huge over capacity in the electricity system, and disproportionate fixed cost obligations for many discoms. In conjunction with delayed payments from cash-strapped government entities and the requirement to provide free and subsidised power to significant segments of their customer base, this has been a recipe for disaster,\u201d note authors Ashish Fernandes, CEO and lead analyst, CRH, and Harshit Sharma, lead researcher.In her Budget speech in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that utilities would be urged to shut down old and polluting power plants to meet air emission norms.The States analysed were Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. They together account for nearly half of discom dues.The surplus generation capacity notwithstanding, an additional 60,000 MW thermal power is officially under construction across the country, with another 29,000 MW in the proposal/permitting stage. Of this, 17,235 MW is likely to be completed by 2022 in these States."

        "total news": "Krishnadas Rajagopal\nNEW DELHI \nAir passengers have a legitimate right to get full refund for their tickets cancelled due to no fault of their own during the national lockdown, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has told the Supreme Court.The DGCA said non-refund of fares or creation of \u201cinvoluntary credit shell\u201d by airlines amounts to violation of aviation law and policy, including the Aircraft Rules of 1937 and the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs). \u201cThe policy of the Central government is that every individual passenger has a right to seek refund of those tickets, the flight for which was cancelled without any fault of his/hers. It is stated that non-refund of fare amounts to violation of provisions of the CARs,\u201d the DGCA addressed the court.But the Directorate also reasoned that an enforcement action against an already financially distressed sector now would prove counter-productive and harm the \u201cIndian aviation as a whole\u201d. Instead, the DGCA, in a 48-page affidavit, sounded out a proposal worked out by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to \u201charmonise both passengers\u2019 interests and airline viability\u201d.The affidavit and the proposal therein is the result of a direction from a three-judge Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, on June 12 to the Ministry to meet with airlines and work out a credit pattern for tickets cancelled during the lockdown.According to this proposal, passengers who booked their tickets during the lockdown will get an immediate and full refund from the airlines. \u201cFor all the other cases, the airlines shall make all endeavours to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days,\u201d the proposal said.The phrase \u201call the other cases\u201d would include passengers who had booked their tickets before the lockdown was suddenly imposed from March 25 and extended till May 3. But the proposal has also devised an alternative credit shell scheme for airlines too poor to pay a refund.According to this scheme, a credit shell will be opened in the name of the passenger who booked the ticket. This shell is valid up to March 31, 2021. In case the passenger chooses not to use the credit shell, the airline will have to refund the ticket money by the end of March 2021. The credit shell is also transferable to any person of the passenger\u2019s choice.As an incentive mechanism, the proposal offered .5% increase in the valuation of the credit shell if it was not \u201cconsumed\u201d till June 30, 2020.

        "total news": "In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Srishti is explained at the outset itself. \u201cThe world existed first as seed, which as it grew and developed took on names and forms. As a razor in its case, or as fire in wood, so dwells the self, the Lord of the universe, in all forms, even to the tips of the fingers. Yet the ignorant do not know Him who remains hidden behind the names and forms.\u201d In a discourse, Sri Rajagopala Sarma drew attention to the fact that the Srutis are so concerned for the well being of the jiva that they try to help him overcome this ignorance of the self that stands as a great hurdle to spiritual progress. The fundamental teaching is to reinforce the same non-dual nature of the self that is in the jiva as well as the Ishwara. The Supreme Brahman is the antaryami in all creation. When the self is associated with avidya it is known as jiva, and when in association with Maya it is Ishwara. So, Maya and avidya are the adjuncts of the self that appears as Ishwara and Jiva respectively. At the time of Pralaya, Ishwara is not associated with Maya. There is no creation. He is in unmanifest form.This is the causal or karana sarira of Brahman that is worshipped by great devotees. But not all can rise to this level. So Ishwara also takes the form of the sukshma sarira, known as Hiranyagarbha for the sake of upasana by quite a few devotees. For many others who are still to reach this level, there is the more accessible sthula form of Ishwara, the Virat swaroopa, such as the vision that was revealed to Arjuna. Suppose even this is not possible, Sruti comes down to show how to do upasana of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra, in their roles of srishti, stiti and laya."

The Evangelical Churches Association (ECA) was founded in 1952 in Manipur. The origins of the group can be traced to a Welsh Presbyterian missionary who visited in 1910. According to the website of Ecreosoculis North-Western Gossner Evangelical, its origin is rooted in the development of the Gossner mission of Germany in Chhotanagpur region. The Northern Evangelical Lutheran Church was established in 1987 and is part of a global communion of 148 churches in the Lutheran tradition, representing over 77 million Christians in 99 countries, its website says.

The ambulance driver, identified as Noufal, 29, of Kayamkulam, has been arrested. According to the police, the 19-year-old woman was being shifted to a COVID care centre at Pandalam from Adoor when the assault took place. The victim, along with an 42-year-old woman patient, boarded the ambulance at Adoor.After dropping the first patient at the District General Hospital in Kozhencherry, the ambulance proceeded to a COVID care facility at Pandalam with the second patient. As they reached Aranmula, the accused took a diversion to an isolated location and molested the patient. He then allegedly apologised to the woman and dropped her at the Pandalam centre.\u2018Planned attack\u2019The victim revealed her ordeal to the health officials on duty who, in turn, informed the police. After collecting the victim\u2019s statement, the police traced the location of the accused and took him to into custody.Preliminary investigations revealed that the accused had planned the rape and diverted the ambulance through Kozhencherry instead of going straight to Pandalam from Adoor. The official also confirmed that Noufal had been arraigned as an accused in an attempted culpable homicide case in Kayamkulam. A probe is on to trace his criminal antecedents. The accused was booked under IPC Sections 375 for rape, 363 for kidnapping, 342 for wrongful confinement, 323 for voluntarily causing hurt and also under provisions of the SC/ST Atrocities Act. He was later remanded to custody and put in an isolation unit. Official sources said the case would be handed over to the Aranmula police station, where the incident actually took place.

The report sought the removal of names of 387 \u2018Moplah rioters\u2019 from the list of martyrs. The book, Dictionary of Martyrs: India\u2019s Freedom Struggle 1857-1947, was released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week.Martyrs from the southC.I. Issac, an ICHR member, submitted the 2016 report to the Council, recommending the deletion of the names when the fifth volume, covering martyrs of the freedom struggle from south India, came up for review.The report, accessed by The Hindu, describes Haji as the \u201cnotorious Moplah Riot leader\u201d and a \u201chardcore criminal,\u201d who \u201ckilled innumerable innocent Hindu men, women, and children during the 1921 Moplah Riot, and deposited their bodies in a well, locally known as Thoovoor Kinar\u201d. Haji was arrested by the army, tried by an army court and shot dead on January 20, 1922, the report said.The ICHR recently constituted a three-member committee, including Mr. Issac, to review the entries in the dictionary, including those of Haji and Ali Musliyar.The review report said, \u201cAlmost all the Moplah outrages were communal. They were against Hindu society and done out of sheer intolerance. Thus, the following names should be deleted from the yet-to-be published project.\u201d Mr. Issac is also the vice-president of the Bharatiya Vichara Kendram.\u2018For taking part in riots\u2019\u201cNone of those who died in the Wagon Tragedy were freedom fighters of India as they hoisted the Khilafat flag and established Khilafat and Khilafat courts for a brief period. They were arrested by the army for participating in riots. Around 10 Hindus who participated in the riots too are on the list of persons to be removed from the dictionary,\u201d said Mr. Issac.The British convicted the rioters after proper trial. While some were hanged to death, some died in jail and some others in hospitals. These dead were never recognised as freedom fighters elsewhere, he added."

The Centre has not paid at least two instalments of GST dues.\u2018Four different rates\u2019In the third edition of the video series on economy, Mr. Gandhi said, \u201cWhy are there four different rates? This is because the government wants those who have the means to be able to easily change GST, and those who don\u2019t have means, cannot do anything about GST. Who has the means? India's biggest 15-20 industrialists. So, whatever tax law they want to change can easily be done in this GST regime.\u201d \u201cNot only is it [the GST system] unsuccessful, it is an attack on the poor and on the small and medium businesses. GST is not a tax system, it is an attack on India\u2019s poor,\u201d he said. Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram, meanwhile, tweeted six steps to revive the economy. The foremost step, he said, was to transfer cash to the poorest 50% of the families. Free food grains should be offered to all families. Governmental expenditure on infrastructure projects needed an increase and good grain stock could be used to pay wages in kind. The banks needed to be re-capitalised to enable them to lend. And lastly,the government must immediately pay the arrears of GST compensation to the States, said Mr. Chidambaram."

These committees have been formed in view of the March 2022 Assembly election in the State. Insiders pointed out that it is unprecedented for the party to start preparations two years in advance. The other notable omission is of senior leader RPN Singh, who had a face-off with former party president Rahul Gandhi at a recent meeting of the Congress Working Committee in June. Mr. Singh had suggested that the party must ensure criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the Chinese incursion should not get personal. Mr. Gandhi lost his temper at this suggestion accusing the other senior leaders of going easy on the BJP and Mr. Modi. Mr. Singh is not a signatory to the G23 letter. Leaving out Mr. Prasada and Mr. Singh is more surprising, insiders said, because both are considered close to the Gandhi family. Mr. Singh has also had a successful stint as in-charge of Jharkhand, where the party is part of the JMM-led government. More recently, the party re-jigged its team in Parliament, appointing Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi as the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, superseding former UPA Ministers Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor. Both Mr. Tharoor and Mr. Tewari were signatories to the G23 letter. \u201cIf this trend holds on, then both Shashi Tharoor and Anand Sharma [who too is part of G23] will not be renominated as chairpersons of the standing committees,\u201d another senior leader said."

Though the judgment is a landmark case, he did not win any relief in the case. The amendments in the Kerala land reforms law, which he had challenged, were upheld by the Supreme Court in 1973.It was senior advocate Nani Palkhivala, representing Swamiji, who extended the ambit of the case. Mr. Palkhivala saw an opportunity through Swamiji's case to challenge a series of constitutional amendments introduced by the Indira Gandhi government, granting unlimited power to Parliament to alter the Constitution.\u201cCourtroom Genius\u201d, a biography of Mr. Palkhivala co-authored by senior advocates Soli Sorabjee and Arvind Datar, said the seer never met or spoke with the great lawyer. In fact, the book said, Swamiji was quite surprised at the time to see his name in the newspapers every day and wondered why his case, challenging only certain land reforms in Kerala, was taking so long.Unique caseBy sheer statistics, leave alone the law it laid down, the \u201cKesavananda Bharati versus State of Kerala\u201d case is unique. The case was heard by a Bench of 13 judges \u2014 the largest formed in the Supreme Court. It was heard over 68 working days from October 1972 to March 1973. The judgment was a mammoth 703 pages.The Kesavananda Bharati judgment innovated the Basic Structure doctrine which limited Parliament\u2019s power to make drastic amendments that may affect the core values enshrined in the Constitution, like secularism and federalism. The verdict upheld the power of the Supreme Court to judicially review laws of Parliament. It evolved the concept of separation of powers among the three branches of governance \u2014 legislative, executive and the judiciary.But democracy won that day on a wafer-thin 7:6 majority. The judges were split down the middle until the 13th judge, Justice H.R. Khanna, supported the view that constitutional amendments should not alter the \u201cbasic structure\u201d of the Constitution. The aftermath of the judgment also saw the supersession of three judges of the Supreme Court \u2014 J.M. Shelat, A.N. Grover and K.S. Hegde \u2014 for Chief Justiceship. All three were part of the majority verdict on the Bench. They resigned in protest amidst public furore.The Emergency was proclaimed shortly after the judgment was delivered on April 24, 1973. The Kesavananda Bharati judgment proved timely and thwarted many an attempt on democracy and dignity of individual during those dark years."

What I said is even if criticism is intemperate or unfair and bordering on scurrilous and abusive, it will be understood for what it is by the people. People can make out that this criticism is scurrilous and unfair. The court\u2019s reputation depends on its judgments and actions. It is not dependent on what people say. The court\u2019s reputation is affected by what people say only if it seems to have a ring of fairness and authenticity. Trying to use the law of scandalising and lowering the authority by way of contempt to stifle criticism just because some of it may be scurrilous or totally unfair is counterproductive and especially dangerous because it ends up stifling honest opinion. It was my, and remains my, bona fide opinion about the role of court in the last few years. Somebody may agree with it or not, but that does not make it contempt. I am not saying the whole of contempt law should go, but [the ground of] scandalising of court should go.The court blames your \u201cadamance and ego\u201d for not apologising. Even the Attorney-General, as a constitutional authority, asked you to express regret to the court. Did you think that you would be giving ground by not apologising to an institution you hold in high esteem?One should at least have some self-righteous ego. Not in the sense that you refuse to apologise even when judges reason with you to apologise ... [but] in the sense that nobody can force you to apologise if there is no reason to do so. If you have not said anything wrong and if you fully believe in what you have said, then your ego should be such, your self-righteousness should be such that you don\u2019t cave in just because they are offering you an easy way out ... That self-righteous ego is a must for any self-respecting, truth-loving person. The court\u2019s judgment says judges are handicapped when attacked. It is contempt to attribute personal motives to judges. But is it not healthier for the institution and dignity of office if individual judges are allowed to defend themselves and respond to attacks?In my view, they [judges] should be able to respond to criticism levelled against them. Others can also respond to these remarks, and they do. On the question of motives, sometimes motives are there for all to see. For example, there have been cases where judges have a serious conflict of interest and they still deal with those cases. Is wider consultation necessary before initiating contempt on the ground of scandalising the court? Suo motu initiation of contempt should only be after a meeting of the Full Court. Secondly, there must be an appeal against this judgment. One appeal ... one criminal appeal is held to be a fundamental right under Article 21 by the Supreme Court. There is no appeal against this. Review goes to the same Bench in chambers.A tweet is shared rapidly. It attracts hundreds or even thousands of comments which vary from funny to abusive. Is contempt practical?Theoretically, it [contempt] can be done, but it is not in public interest to do so because people will stop making even bona fide and fair comments. Are opinions expressed in social media a reflection of public opinion and faith in an institution? By and large, they are. There may be some people who level criticism or attack the court due to vested interest. But on the whole, they are a reflection of public opinion.As a senior lawyer and officer of the court, should you have been more guarded in your tweets?No, my motorcycle tweet... It was primarily meant to underline why the courts are being kept under lockdown. It is leading to real problems for litigants ... See the number of cases normally heard by the court and the cases being heard during lockdown through videoconferencing ... It is hardly 10% ...Do virtual court hearings give ample opportunity to substantiate defence in a criminal contempt case, especially when personal liberty is at risk?It is not just a question of personal liberty, but proper and fair hearing. We cannot have a proper hearing through e-conferencing.The contempt action was confined to two tweets. Yet your reply delved into various past instances in connection with the court. The court termed these allegations \u201cwild\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d. The reply was described as an aggravation of contempt. Why did you file this reply? What did you want to convey to the court?I was showing my bona fide. That look, I absolutely believed what I said. There were three things I said ... First, democracy has been substantially destroyed in the last six years. Second, the court has facilitated or allowed the destruction of democracy in the last six years. Last, four CJIs have played a significant role in that destruction. I dealt with each of these in the reply to show why I felt that democracy has been substantially destroyed. Look at the assault on free speech, look at the destruction of regulatory institutions, look at the assault on the media ... And then I said the role of the Supreme Court is to protect democracy and fundamental rights. You were willing to be punished, saying truth is your defence. Mr. Rajeev Dhavan [Mr. Bhushan\u2019s lawyer] urged the court not to punish you and make you a martyr. Was there a disparity in thought here between you and your counsel?No, he felt it would be further damaging to the court if they send me to jail. That was his view.Have you paid the \u20b9 1 fine?Not yet."

When virtual classes commenced, she spent the first session asking us what we had been up to during the lockdown and just spending time with us. \u201cI miss seeing all your faces,\u201d she said. Now that our classes are online, she makes an effort to keep them lively and interactive through digital aids. I have been taking a leaf out of her book and trying to be punctual.Saureesh Namagiri,IIIrd year, Bachelor of Management Studies, Shiv Nadar University, Dadri, Greater Noida, Uttar PradeshMy professors have shown more concern about our well being than ourselves. When our semesters moved online, they helped us adapt and sent frequent emails of encouragement and assurance. They quickly familiarised themselves with online tools and gave us tutorials on how to navigate them. I was among the few students who remained on campus throughout the semester and the summer and was amazed at how my professors went out of the way to help. At one point, we weren\u2019t sure if we would be allowed to stay back in the hostel. A marketing professor offered to house as many of us as she could, in her staff quarters. My sociology professor offered to let some of us cook food of our choice at her place because the mess food was getting monotonous. Occasionally, a few professors would drop by the hostel to share home-made food with us.Shivanshu Pande,II, Computer Science Engineering,BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru, KarnatakaI would like to thank all my teachers including those in BMS College of Engineering. Even during the pandemic, they continued to teach complex topics in simple ways, making test papers and checking them too, despite their household chores. A special mention to my college\u2019s computer science department for all the guidance, specially my computer science teacher Mrs. KVN, who taught me C programming with great patience as I had not learnt this before joining college. She also kept in touch during some tough times. Mehul Shah,IIIrd year, BSc Information Technology, Vidyalankar School of Information Technology, Mumbai, MaharashtraAlthough we miss the campus, our teachers continue to play a vital link in keeping our focus on learning. Previously, we used the Internet for entertainment, but we now realise that it is for Edutainment. After the move from live interaction to distance learning, things have changed from \u201cGood Morning, students\u201d to \u201cAm I audible ?\u201d Although things have changed, I am thankful to my teachers for keeping our enthusiasm and learning spirit intact. They have again proved they are the backbone of education. Helen Mary Bob,IIIrd year, BBA, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, KeralaMy teachers have really moved out of their comfort zones to teach us. My professor Nikhil sir told us how heartbreaking it was to see a college without students; it is just a building with a name tag. I also remember how Jose sir had trouble with his network. He went around his house holding his laptop, to get better range so that he could teach us without any interruption. All the teachers truly give their maximum to give us the best. I would like thank all our teachers who have put in so much effort in providing us the best through an online platform during this time. Gopalchetty Brahma,IInd year, B.Tech (Aerospace Engineering), Lovely Professional University, Phagwara, PunjabIt amazes me to see how my teachers have kept up with the transition and are coping up with the challenges, as the university shifts gears from the traditional classrooms to online learning. They address our problems through all possible platforms. While their work hours were limited to college timings earlier, now they are available to help us with notes and clarifications round-the-clock, without any complaints. Also, handling many students virtually, especially with uncertain Internet connectivity and speed, and explaining topics and clearing doubts repeatedly is daunting. But our teachers cope with a smile. They have taken a personal interest in our performance and participation in activities and also keep an eye on our mental well being. They took extra effort to connect with us personally through telephone, video conferencing and even chat, to motivate and keep us going.Maathangi Venkatraman,IIIrd year, B.Arch, School of Planning and Architecture, Vijayawada, Andhra PradeshCrackling voices and frozen screens. The \u2018new normal\u2019 classroom is nowhere near how regular classrooms used to be, but that hasn\u2019t deterred any of my teachers from doing their job the way they used to. A sick professor took his practical class online, and this made me feel obliged to go the extra mile and pay more attention than I usually do.Vaidehi Yogesh Devi,IInd year, MIT School of Engineering, MIT ADT University, Pune, MaharashtraAs students, our greatest challenge was to cope with academics while being away from college and our teachers. But our teachers are facing a tougher challenge: of looking after their homes as well as conducting online lectures. Not just that but also the entire process of planning and scheduling required. Moreover, when we reach out to them, I see how they put away their personal work and attend to our questions, however silly they may be. They make us feel like we are with them, and are warm and comforting. I am grateful more to my teachers than before. I miss going to college and hope to be back soon for a hands-on leaning session with my teachers. Happy Teachers\u2019 Day.Aayusi Biswas,IVth year, Computer Science, SRM University, Amaravati, Andhra PradeshOur teachers rose to the occasion wonderfully as all of us worked to adapt to the online environment. There were times when Dr. Jatindra Kumar Dash couldn\u2019t conduct classes as scheduled due to low Internet connectivity. To make up, he would forgo his Sunday and compensate. He even took an hour-long special class for some of us who missed sessions. He has been motivating us to research remotely, and even taught us how to do so. Thanks to his help and guidance, I might even land an internship from a prestigious foreign university. I was also impressed with how each teacher took our feedback on their online classes, and how they could improve. Hats off to all of them."

        "total news": "Viney Kirpal Teachers had less than a week to prepare for the online delivery of the courses left incomplete, due to the hasty closing down of schools and colleges, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Remote teaching/learning was an emergency solution. Many had never dabbled in online teaching.Indian teachers are used to chalk-and-talk teaching, which is a practical way of communicating concepts, clarifying doubts, teaching even subjects such as math and Engineering. Besides, it is a method that works in all circumstances and locations. Students too are used to following the teacher as she teaches on the board. The general bustle and the playfulness of students also keeps them and the teacher engaged and relaxed.Technology in towA couple of colleges arranged a brief training for teachers on the use of Google Meet, and Zoom. However, Dr. Jaslene Bawa, who teaches Accounting and Costing at FLAME University, Pune, remarked, \u201cNobody prepared us for the challenges of teaching online.\u201d Many others agreed with her. Professor Anurag Mehra who teaches Chemical Engineering at IIT Bombay spoke of the difficulty of speaking to the camera in the absence of students and suggested dropping of minor courses and focusing on the major ones, as this would make it easier for everyone.Bawa, Mehra, and Professor Anjali Gera Roy, who teach English at IIT Kharagpur, sorely miss the live interaction with theirstudents. Roy says that looking at students enables a teacher to use their non-verbal responses to change towards what\u2019s of interest to them.Student feedback also reveals they have missed the face-to-face interaction. They say it is difficult to clarify doubts. Some teachers have devised options for students to raise questions/doubts, through e-mail group or special sessions on course websites.Though the faculty interviewed come from the better-endowed institutions, not all their students have high-powered Internet connections, iPads, laptops or Android phones at home. Teachers fear that such students are being left out. Students too want recorded videos on YouTube instead of attending virtual classes, as they are unable to always attend at the given time due to sharing resources with their family. Roy confirms that, despite being given advance intimation, a section of the class doesn\u2019t attend.Bawa says Google Meet helps her know how many students are present. Mehra is not happy about the students\u2019 non-attendance and recommends they be given loans to buy laptops and data packs. The issue of poor connectivity bothers the faculty, as they also experience connectivity problems making it hard to take virtual classes.Innovation mattersSangeeta Vishwanathan, a science teacher at Ravindranath Tagore English Medium School, Pune, a government school for less privileged students, conducted an online session on cell division for class X students. She used a downloaded video that employed cartoons to explain the complex topic. Vishwanathan focused on explaining only the main concepts in Hindi because students weren\u2019t fluent in English. What I found enjoyable was her interaction with the students. Her tone was conversational and she took pains to teach the two major concepts first by going over the slides. At the end, she revised the concepts with the students. She told them to take screenshots of important slides and said she\u2019d send them the page numbers from their textbook to study. At the end of an hour, a student remarked \u201cMiss, the class is over? So soon?\u201d Out of the total 40 students, 30 attended and enjoyed every minute. Teachers are also trying to discover strategies to test students so they don\u2019t cheat. Should it be short quizzes all along the course, or proctored online tests using a software or home assignments to express their own opinions? It\u2019s a dilemma. Students too are applying their mind on how to help their teachers give their best. Create an offline app, send recorded lectures and notes, give practice sheets and solved problems... a churning of ideas has begun.From general observation, it seems that it would help to train teachers to use Zoom, Webex and Google Meet, and online pedagogical methods. Teachers have taken a courageous leap forward. Improvement is a dynamic process and will continue.Viney Kirpal was Professor of English at IIT Bombay. vineykirpal@gmail.com "

The district falls in the Arunachal West Lok Sabha constituency, represented by Mr. Rijiju.\u201cThe Indian Army has already sent a hotline message to the counterpart PLA establishment at the border point in Arunachal Pradesh. Response is awaited,\u201d the Union Minister tweeted on Sunday.Complaint lodged The district police said they have launched a probe after the families of the missing boys lodged an informal complaint. Nacho is about 130 km from the district headquarters of Daporijo, with a high-altitude jungle stretching further uphill. The five were said to have gone hunting. But Prakash Ringling said his brother Prasad Ringling, one of the missing five, was working as a porter for the Army. The other missing boys were identified as Toch Singkam, Dongtu Ebiya, Tanu Baker and Ngari Diri.There have been several instances in the past of people \u201cabducted\u201d or captured by the Chinese soldiers from the LAC. In March, 21-year-old Togley Sinkam was taken away at gunpoint from the Asapila sector of the district while two of his friends managed to escape. The Chinese Army released him after 19 days in captivity. "

        "total news": "Prime Minister  Modi last week elaborately pitched India as an investment destination that could serve as a manufacturing hub at the heart of global supply chains. The pitch made  at the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum comes in the backdrop of the government\u2019s keenness to use the  disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic  has caused to the cross-border movement of goods as an opportunity to lure potential investors, especially those looking to relocate from China, to India. This tack is consistent with recent initiatives to explore supply-chain synergies with other economies, including Japan, as an escalating border feud casts a shadow over India\u2019s economic and trade ties with its northern neighbour. The reasoning appears to be that if even a few multinational enterprises can be drawn to set up manufacturing bases, either by shifting facilities  or as new additional plants, then not only does the Indian economy stand to gain FDI, new jobs and tax revenue but it also makes a statement. Clearly, officials must have advised Mr. Modi  that U.S. businesses were the ideal target given the worsening relationship between Washington and Beijing and the ongoing trade stand-off between the world\u2019s two largest economies. On the face of it, the approach seems inarguably sound. The rub, however, lies in the government\u2019s recent \u2018Aatmanirbhar Bharat\u2019 initiative, of making India more self-reliant.Over the decades, it has been established that global FDI investors prioritise and are even willing to pay a premium for policy stability and largely barrier-free access to local and international markets. The  drive for self-reliance has spurred several Ministries to urge companies and industry sectors to replace imports with \u2018Made in India\u2019 substitutes. From the Shipping Ministry\u2019s call for the design and manufacture of indigenous tugboats to auto component makers being told to abjure foreign parts, the thrust of the initiative is evidently \u2018import substitution\u2019. It is hard to imagine any potential foreign investor in manufacturing being ready to source capital goods locally \u2014 assuming they are  available \u2014 even at the cost of possibly compromising on quality or price or both. Betraying the government\u2019s anxiety, Mr. Modi took pains to stress that the push for self-reliance should not be interpreted as India turning its back on the world. Separately, from the market access perspective, India\u2019s decision to not join the RCEP multilateral trade pact would put investor companies seeking to tap consumers in RCEP member countries at a tariff disadvantage. Interestingly, most of the recent FDI announcements have been by way of stake acquisitions in existing businesses, and predominantly in the services sector. Attracting FDI into manufacturing will require the government to convince investors that it is committed not merely in words but in deeds as well to an open, barrier-free global trade and investment order."

        "total news": "The New Education Policy misses the vital empirical evidence of Tamil Nadu following a language formula that is distinctly at variance with that of Delhi for the past 50 years and yet achieving significant positive social and economic changes. That many are  oblivious of it is surprising. Annadurai\u2019s visionIt was the decision of C.N. Annadurai, who realised the Dravidian movement\u2019s dream of achieving governmental power, that beyond Tamil and English (in  order of preference) no other language would be taught in the schools of Tamil Nadu either as a language or medium of instruction. The far-sightedness of this decision can be better appreciated if one goes through the language policy adopted by various developed countries. Most  countries follow a one-language formula (invariably mother tongue) for teaching  children in the primary classes. On reaching middle school they are given a chance to learn one more language, mostly English. As there is no imposition through schools, voluntary learning of other languages is widely prevalent in these countries. Be it students of literature, sociology, or people involved in international trade, their knowledge  of five or six languages is quite normal. In SingaporeAll countries faced with the enormous challenge posed by the new century, invariably give preference to the English language after their mother tongue. Japan and Singapore can be cited as two countries which handle language policy as a strategic tool to achieve socio-economic development. Singapore\u2019s success in this area is phenomenal and closely comparable to the situation in India. It was the mission of Lee Kuan Yew, the architect of modern Singapore, giving equal status to English and mother tongue as a prerequisite not only to work closely with the international community but also to bring in big ticket changes. In many ways this can be compared to  Annadurai\u2019s mission. Lee Kuan Yew attributed the international acclaim Singapore received for its success mainly to its  two-language formula. Though Chinese by birth, his elitist family spoke English at home. Having studied in  English schools and receiving  his higher education in Cambridge, he understood the importance of English for the then undeveloped society in coping with international competition. Importantly, Lee Kuan Yew realised that  a multicultural society such as  Singapore could enhance its status only if each of its cultural groups felt that it was on a par with others. He viewed that the lingua franca of the country should be equidistant to all cultural groups, thereby creating fair competition and opportunities. Only in this background were Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English  declared as common languages with the lingua franca being English. The mainstay of Annadurai\u2019s  argument, while insisting that all the national languages should be made official languages and English should be the common link language, was that the official language should be equidistant to all the members of a multilingual society. English would fit the bill for both students of Hindi and Tamil. Making Hindi alone as the official language would create disparity among various linguistic groups other than the Hindi-speaking population which will result in partial treatment, giving unfair advantage to the Hindi-speaking population. Annadurai  was against this injustice. Annadurai  was also particular that English is the language we communicate with a larger world. The American example he cited during a parliamentary debate  is worth mentioning: \u201cWhen USA emerged as a nation only 20% of the people went from the British Isles\u2026Yet America has chosen English as the official language.\u201d What Annadurai dreamed of as a language policy for \u2018the Dravidian land\u2019 was actually implemented in Singapore by Lee Kuan Yew . Singapore had much more justification to adopt Chinese as its sole official language than India insisting on Hindi being  the sole official language. Even today the population of Hindi-speaking people has not crossed 50% in India; in  Singapore, 74.2% of the population is  Chinese, 13.2% Malays and 9.2% Indians. If Lee Kuan Yew had wished he could have well declared Chinese to be the sole official language and satisfied the Chinese who were in a majority. He could have used this as a nationalistic tool and cemented his place politically forever. But he  resisted this temptation. He  not only selected English but also recognised languages of every social group. He mandated that each Singaporean should learn their respective mother tongue along with English. He was of the firm view that only the roots one has in his/her mother tongue would be shaping his/her future personality. The world celebrates the decision made by  Lee Kuan Yew after taking into consideration the possibilities, limitations and challenges faced by a third world country. They praise him for his two-language policy which prepared  Singaporeans in advance for globalisation. Have the \u2018experts\u2019 ever discussed the contribution of Annadurai\u2019s  two-language formula in the background of Tamil Nadu being one of the developed States in India despite not possessing a trade and big capital like Gujarat or Maharashtra or having water resources and land fertility like  Kerala and Punjab or the political bargaining power by sheer size and population  by States such as Uttar Pradesh? And when will they be discussing the Indian government\u2019s failure in the language policy in the backdrop of inequalities prevailing among societies since  Independence? Reality check in Tamil NaduThough comparable to Singapore in far-sightedness and in the forefront as far as India is concerned, in the present scenario, Tamil Nadu\u2019s education standards are not comparable to Singapore\u2019s in terms of outcomes. Our students suffer a serious handicap while dealing with English and Tamil languages. And they do not have command over either. Yet this is not the failure of the two-language formula per se but of its implementation and the present Indian educational ecosystem. Even teaching in the mother tongue or the teaching of two languages is filled with  challenges, does India take into account the challenges in teaching three languages? If  India is really interested in the new education policy capable of creating new generations, Delhi can acquire that vision only by studying  the educational ecosystem  throughout the world and comparing it with the strengths and weaknesses of  Tamil Nadu\u2019s. Working towards the possibility of implementing the two-language formula successfully throughout India would throw light not only on India\u2019s education policy but also on its official language policy.

        "total news": "Following Friday\u2019s talks in Moscow between the Defence Ministers of India and China, the prospects of an imminent diplomatic solution to the continuing stand-off along the LAC do not appear bright. The statements issued by the two sides have underlined the sharp differences in how New Delhi and Beijing have continued to view the unprecedented developments along the border since May, when China deployed troops in large numbers and sought to unilaterally redraw the LAC in several areas. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh \u201ccategorically conveyed\u201d India\u2019s stand, emphasising that China\u2019s actions \u201cwere in violation of the bilateral agreements\u201d. He also expressed hope that both sides would be able to resolve the ongoing situation \u201cpeacefully through dialogue\u201d. His Chinese counterpart, General Wei Fenghe, appeared to only reiterate the stand conveyed by China in recent statements that it had no blame to bear for this summer\u2019s developments. He said \u201cthe responsibility lies entirely with the Indian side\u201d, while China \u201ckept maximum restraint to prevent potential escalation\u201d. He called on India to \u201cimmediately withdraw its troops\u201d. He did, also, add that both sides should \u201cstay committed to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation\u201d and \u201cmake joint efforts to meet each other halfway\u201d. As External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said last week, diplomacy is the only way out of the  crisis, and that can only happen \u201cif both sides understand that it is in each of their best interests if the events of this summer are not repeated\u201d. The problem, so far, has been a stark mismatch between China\u2019s  statements  and the actions of its troops. Its consistent labelling of India as the aggressor this summer contradicts the reality that India has, since May, ceded about 1,000 square kilometres  in Ladakh to Chinese control. If China\u2019s diplomats have spoken repeatedly of the need to keep in mind \u201cthe big picture\u201d of bilateral ties, the actions of its military on the ground have suggested an intent that is precisely the opposite, emphasising achieving tactical gains at the border over the broader strategic relationship. Until that calculus changes, India will have to be prepared to be tested along the border and to stand its ground over the long haul. India has signalled its intent to do so with the latest developments on August 29 in Chushul.  If the statements following the Moscow  meet did not exactly inspire confidence, both sides will have the chance to reassess the situation when Mr. Jaishankar will likely meet his counterpart, Wang Yi, at a meeting of SCO Foreign Ministers on September 10. Military talks can occasionally help to avert a flare-up, but the two neighbours need to work toward a diplomatic solution to ensure undisturbed peace and quiet along the border."

Buttler then smashed a six down the ground to seal the contest.Earlier, Australia, after opting to bat, was restricted to 157 for seven. Jofra Archer and Mark Wood struck in their first overs to remove David Warner for a duck and Alex Carey for two. Steve Smith was run out for 10 off a direct hit from Morgan.Aaron Finch (40) and Marcus Stoinis (35) stitched together a 49-run partnership while Glenn Maxwell scored a quickfire 26 off 18 balls to give the Aussies something to defend, but Buttler showed that it was not enough.The scores: Australia 157 for seven in 20 overs (Finch 40, Stoinis 35, Jordan 2/40) lost to England 158 for four in 18.5 overs (Buttler 77 n.o., Malan 42, Agar 2/27).

        "total news": "This past fortnight has seen two significant developments in connection with the Indian judiciary: the first was the decision of the Supreme Court of India in the matter of Prashant Bhushan\u2019s contempt case, and the second was the retirement of Justice Arun Mishra. These  events, in their own way, magnify the chinks in the armour of the Supreme Court. The Bhushan caseIn the first instance, the Supreme Court, in a display of self-proclaimed \u201cmagnanimity\u201d, let off Mr. Bhushan with a fine of one rupee in  the contempt case against him over two tweets. In the alternative, the top court ordered for a three-month imprisonment term and three years\u2019 debarment from practice. The Court chastised him for his \u201cconduct\u201d, which, according to the Court, \u201creflects adamance and ego, which has no place to exist in the system of administration of justice and in noble profession, and no remorse is shown for the harm done to the institution to which he belongs\u201d. It would be trite to say that these words ring hollow coming from a Court that chose to relentlessly pursue Mr. Bhushan in a petty exhibition of arrogance itself. Over the course of the hearing, the Court repeatedly tried to coerce the contemnor, i.e., Mr. Bhushan, to proffer an apology, and kept granting him additional time (a few days, a few hours, etc.) for this purpose. It was arguably strange behaviour on the part of the Court, and it also appeared embarrassing, for it came across as petulant bargaining more than anything else. Mr. Bhushan, with appropriate decorum and honesty, admitted that any apology from him in the circumstances would be insincere. The jurisprudential contribution of this decision to the law of contempt will be studied for years to come, surely, but maybe not for the reasons that the Court intended. Hopefully, a wiser judicial and legislative community will realise one day how utterly self-defeating this law is for a healthy democracy, and eventually change the law around. A judge in the limelightThis was among Justice Mishra\u2019s last few decisions as a member of the Supreme Court, before he retired on September 2. As a result, considerable attention has been paid to his decisions during his tenure which lasted from 2014 to 2020. One consistent feature has revealed itself throughout, which is the kinds of cases that were assigned to the Benches he was on, and the kinds of decisions he issued. In the judges\u2019 press conference two years ago, the primary grouse was with the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d system, and the specific concern that politically sensitive cases (i.e., dealing with the executive) were being allocated to Benches involving Justice Arun Mishra (even if not mentioned by name, his role was clearly insinuated, notably with reference to the judge Loya case). Commentators (e.g., Aparna Chandra, Anup Surendranath, V. Venkatesan) have also conducted detailed analyses of Justice Arun Mishra\u2019s decisions, and studies have found that these were predictably in favour of the executive. In recent times, many columnists, leading scholars, and legal luminaries have speculated on the marked drift of the Supreme Court away from rights-based court to an executive court. Of course, to keep such a court going, a judge who is ever ready to step up to handle politically sensitive matters, and who can be relied upon to issue decisions that are in favour of the executive, is always useful. However, even as the limelight is on a judge such as  Justice Mishra in circumstances like this, the role of the office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in facilitating the creation of an executive court cannot be ignored. Allegations and suspicions have been voiced from within as well, with Justice Kurian Joseph suggesting that the assignment of work in the Court during Justice Dipak Misra\u2019s tenure was \u201cremote controlled\u201d. During his time, two judgments were delivered by the CJI\u2019s Bench in matters to which he himself was a party. Through these judgments, the CJI defended the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d system, indicating that the CJI was entitled to have unrestricted and untrammelled power in matters of case allocation. After the press conference, one hoped there would be rethinking on this, but nothing has really happened, and things have continued in the same way since. The \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d system was designed for a different era, and indeed, may have worked well in the past even, when we had very tall judges, and judicial independence was rarely doubted. But things have changed now. Recall that the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act was struck down by the Court on grounds of excessive executive interference in the selection of judges. But surely, this judgment is of no use if executive interference is anyway possible in more subtle ways.Executive\u2019s chipping awayTheoretically, it is very easy for an all-powerful executive that is looking to seize control over the other arms of the state, and especially an independent judiciary. There is no need to expend energy in packing the Supreme Court with pro-government judges. Finding over 30 judges who think alike would anyway be difficult, if not impossible. All that is needed is to ensure that certain \u201cfavourable\u201d conditions exist in the Court: these include a CJI who is on your side, and a handful of other judges on the Bench who are \u201creliable\u201d. Unfortunate precedents in the recent past where CJIs have, without compunction, accepted politically-coloured post-retirement opportunities, have  not really helped. The competence of judges becomes irrelevant in this scheme of things. The combination of opaque systems like the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d, and a certain kind of CJI are sufficient to destroy all that is considered precious by an independent judiciary. Of course, this is far from being a hypothetical scenario, and is, in fact, playing out in India right now. The truly independent and competent judges in the Court have been relegated to adjudicating private disputes, and are considered inconsequential. Many commentators have already pointed out how the last three CJIs all used the powers anointed upon themselves via the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d to entrust sensitive and important matters to Benches involving Justice Arun Mishra.The other thing to note is that these \u201creliable\u201d judges not only ensure that the pro-executive nature of the Court is sustained, but also serve to protect the CJI in times of crises. Again, this is not mere theory or speculation. As an example, the medical admissions scam case during Justice Dipak Misra\u2019s tenure as CJI was handed over to Justice Arun Mishra\u2019s Bench. Similarly, the infamous hearing of Justice Gogoi\u2019s sexual harassment case included Justice Arun Mishra. The European exampleThere is enough evidence that the \u201cmaster of the roster\u201d system does not work any more. What we need today is legal certainty, and a rules-based mechanism for allocation of cases (e.g., as followed by the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, among many other jurisdictions where cases are decided not by full courts but by benches). This rule can be that cases are allocated randomly. But any kind of rule can be implemented only if judges themselves take a stand and decide. There should be agreement that no discretion can be allowed, for that is the root cause of so many of our troubles. A case allocation system that is neutral and rules-based will prevent bench packing, and demonstrate neutrality, impartiality, and transparency. All this, in turn, ensures that courts are protected from outside interference; improves public confidence in the impartiality and independence of the judiciary; assures litigants of equality and fairness; and protects basic rights and freedoms by not compromising on them.Malaise withinThere is a tendency to view the threat to judicial independence in India as emerging from the executive branch, and occasionally the legislature. But when persons within the judiciary become pliable to the other branches, it is a different story altogether. Today, we have a situation which was foreseen many decades ago, by CJI Y.V. Chandrachud, when, in 1985, he observed, \u201cThere is greater threat to the independence of the judiciary from within than without ....\u201d All the sermonising in the world (of the sort offered in the Bhushan judgment) will be of no consequence without any real changes in the way things work. And indeed, it is important to note that Justice Arun Mishra\u2019s retirement is not likely to impact the situation; he was anyway merely a manifestation of the deeper malaise in the system. Surely, this is as good a time as any for the judges of the Supreme Court  to unite and seriously consider whether self-preservation trumps institutional independence, or whether they truly want to protect the judiciary from outside influence, and hold their own against an overbearing executive.

        "total news": "Reuters\nMONZA\nFrance\u2019s Pierre Gasly won an astonishing Italian Grand Prix thriller for Italy-based AlphaTauri on Sunday in a topsy-turvy race packed with suspense and none of the usual top teams on the podium.McLaren\u2019s Spaniard Carlos Sainz Jr. finished a close second at Monza, after a nail-biting chase to the flag, with Racing Point\u2019s Lance Stroll third on a podium of youngsters.Mercedes\u2019 championship leader Lewis Hamilton finished seventh after starting on pole and dropping to last following a 10-second stop/go penalty for entering the pit lane under a red light while leading.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d gasped Gasly, dropped by Red Bull\u2019s main team last year, after his maiden victory. \u201cIt was such a crazy race and we capitalised on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been through so much in 18 months, I struggle to realise this.\u201d\u201cI was so close but yet so far,\u201d said Sainz, who had also dreamed of taking his first win before joining Ferrari next year. \u201cI needed one more lap.\u201dLeclerc crashesThe race had to be stopped at the halfway mark after Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc crashed heavily into the tyre wall at Parabolica. His teammate Sebastian Vettel had already retired with brake failure. The standing restart from the grid, and Hamilton\u2019s penalty that left the Briton having to make up a 30-second deficit, set up a thrilling 17-car sprint and a glimpse of what a reverse-grid race might look like."
